Examining difference in computing times for different processes. 
Code used for these computations is taken from MPI for python docs - calculating Julia set with dynamic task management.
In a separate experiment computations in one line are artificially increased. 
The behaviour of processes, computing times and distribution of tasks are compared with previous results.
